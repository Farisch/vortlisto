The original word list was created in the 90's for a now-defunct exam (see README.md for more details). It's unclear what the copyright status of that text is.

Bill Walker with others' help provided translations. Those translations came from various sources. (Who owns the translation of a word?)

Bill Walker has kindly given permission for his `gcselist.htm` file to be used to help others learn Esperanto.

I (Paul Makepeace) release the software in this repository into the public domain (CC0; https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0).

My additions to the original list I also release into the public domain.

You're on your own as far as figuring out the status of this derivative work though :-)
