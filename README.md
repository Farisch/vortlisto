# Vortlisto

The goal of "vortlisto" ("word list") is to produce a machine-readable vocabulary of words for an (English-speaking) Esperanto learner.

The source is based on a curated word list produced as part of a UK high school (GCSE) Esperanto syllabus that ran until 1996. The advantages of this source are that there's some academic consensus around the selection; the words are grouped by linguistic categories; "basic" words are tagged; and perhaps most importantly this list exists in a somewhat machine-readable state online already, thanks to [Bill Walker](http://www.wgtw.co.uk/) who created [a giant HTML page of it all](http://home.btclick.com/ukc802510745/eo/vortlist/gcselist.htm) with translations.
  
## Contents

1. `gcselist.htm` - this is the original HTML document
2. `vortlisto.htm` - the original with some additional sub-categories and additional words
3. `csv/*.csv` - a series of CSV files containing Esperanto and English words whose names reflect the category and level
4. `vortlisto.rb` - a Ruby program to convert the fixed HTML doc into the CSV files

## Usage

If you wish to use `vortlisto.rb`'s download capability `gem install httparty`.

Run with `./vortlisto.rb`; run time is about a half second.

## Use in other applications

### Cerego

So far, I've successfully uploaded a CSV file directly to [Cerego](https://cerego.com/) a spaced repetition learning site and app. I'm a fan of Cerego since it really seems to work, the UI & UX are pretty good, and [they publish an API](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1T6hvcS39T7l2lrhuDKihQmAZuSzVQHvrGtq_OExaUc8/pub).

The first word list I uploaded was the "General Basic" list that contains 396 words. It turns out Cerego struggles with a word list this big; the app spins processing all the data (there's a lot of work per-word for its learning algorithm). Cerego recommend lists less than 100 associations. The other issue is that Cerego will present the words in the order they're uploaded which currently means grinding through a giant alphabetized list. Cerego is already full of progress markers so alphabetizing only seems to be a disadvantage.

#### Next steps

The "General Basic" and some other lists need to be made much smaller; less than 100 items each. Two options are arranging into chunks of say 40 words by observed frequency (so learn most common words first) and by additional category like "color", "prepositions", etc. Those subcategories could also be arranged by frequency if only to break up the alphabetizing.

So far I have created some additional sub-categories in "General Basic" which has reduced "General Basic" to about half.
